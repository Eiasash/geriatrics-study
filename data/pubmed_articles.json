      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are chronic neurodegenerative disorders with few effective drug treatments available. An underrated element of these diseases is that glucose uptake and energy utilization is much reduced in neurons. In the brains of patients, signaling of insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and other growth factors is downregulated early on. This leads to reduced glucose utilization and impaired mitochondrial function. In an attempt to compensate for the loss, other pathways are upregulated, e.g., the increased use of ketones produced from fatty acids by astrocytes that are shuttled to neurons. In addition, amino acids are increasingly used to generate energy. Despite this, neurons generate less and less energy over time, leading to impaired synaptic activity, reduced cell repair, mitogenesis, autophagy, the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and finally, to cell death. At the same time, the chronic inflammation response in the brain that is part of these diseases continues to damage neurons. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are peptide hormones and growth factors that have shown neuroprotective effects in animal studies and in clinical trials. GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists were able to reduce inflammation while normalizing growth factor signaling and energy utilization in the brain. Insulin signaling was improved and energy utilization, glucose uptake, mitogenesis, and mitochondrial functionality was brought back to physiological levels. In addition, the chronic inflammation response and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain were much reduced. Clinical trials testing GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with AD or PD have been conducted and have shown first successes, serving as proof of concept that activating GLP-1 receptor is a sensible strategy to treat AD/PD. A phase II study testing liraglutide in patients with AD showed first improvements, and two phase II trials testing exendin-4 (exenatide, Bydureon",

Multimorbidity and polypharmacy were defined according to the number of comorbidities and drugs at baseline. Frailty was defined according to a 40-items frailty index (FI).

      "abstract": "People undergoing hemodialysis (HD) take an average of 12 medications daily, with 93% prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medication or dose. Polypharmacy is commonly defined as taking 5 or more medications per day; however, it can also refer to the use of inappropriate medication choices and doses. Polypharmacy can lead to serious health consequences, including drug-drug interactions, falls, and hospitalizations. Deprescribing, the process of stopping or gradually reducing the dose of a medication that may be causing harm or offers no benefit, can reduce polypharmacy among older adults. However, little research focuses on deprescribing in the HD population, and few tools exist to support deprescribing in HD. To address this gap, we developed and validated the STrategic Optimization of Medication Use in Patients on HemoDialysis (STOPMed-HD) intervention, a deprescribing toolkit which includes clinician-focused algorithms, monitoring forms, and evidence tables, and patient-facing information bulletins and videos. Co-developed with clinicians and patients, the toolkit reflects patient priorities and aligns with their deprescribing goals. This report describes the implementation and evaluation strategy of the STOPMed-HD intervention at 4 HD sites across Canada, and presents insights into barriers, facilitators, and key considerations for implementation.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia and malnutrition are increasingly recognized as major determinants of morbidity and functional decline in aging and chronically ill populations. Thyroid hormones (THs), particularly triiodothyronine (T3), play a critical role in regulating skeletal muscle homeostasis, influencing myogenesis, mitochondrial function, metabolic rate, and fibre-type specification. Alterations in thyroid function, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, negatively impact muscle protein turnover, leading to impaired strength and muscle wasting. Notably, nutritional status modulates TH metabolism at multiple levels: malnutrition impairs deiodinase activity, alters TH transport, and reduces peripheral T3 availability, thereby contributing to the low T3 syndrome frequently observed in frail or undernourished individuals. Conversely, excessive T3 levels, as seen in hyperthyroid states or during inappropriate replacement therapy, exacerbate catabolism and accelerate muscle loss. This review synthesizes current evidence on the bidirectional interactions among thyroid dysfunction, nutritional deficiencies, and sarcopenia, proposing an integrative pathophysiological model. We discuss the clinical implications of TH replacement in sarcopenic and malnourished patients, highlighting the need for personalised, multimodal interventions that include hormonal, nutritional, and physical strategies to prevent or mitigate muscle deterioration in endocrine and geriatric contexts.",

The adverse clinical consequences of malnutrition vary widely from global malnutrition that can result in frailty, cachexia, and/or sarcopenia to micronutrient imbalances that can lead to individual functional alterations. Malnutrition is associated with a higher rate of complications including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding, progressing to liver failure and poor survival outcomes.

      "abstract": "Modern cardiovascular medicine and surgery enable the treatment of complex cardiovascular disease, even in elderly and multimorbid patients, through increasingly sophisticated procedures. Nevertheless, there are situations in which surgical intervention appears medically inappropriate or is explicitly declined by the patient. Similarly, it may become necessary in the postoperative course to revise the original therapeutic goals-particularly when continued survival depends upon prolonged intensive care unit treatment, or when the anticipated quality of life, from the patient's perspective, appears inadequate. While established guidelines and position papers-most notably from the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine-are already available in the field of intensive care medicine, a discipline-specific framework for cardiac surgery has been lacking thus far. This inaugural position paper issued by the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery seeks to contribute to the definition of clinical and ethical standards in the context of therapeutic restraint (Section A) and to the redefinition of therapeutic goals (Section B) within our specialty. The aim is to promote a structured and multiprofessional approach that transparently integrates the core pillars of goal setting in therapy-namely, medical indication and patient autonomy-into a comprehensible decision-making framework. Achieving this objective requires close collaboration among physicians and nursing staff in cardiac surgery, cardiology, intensive care, anesthesiology, ethics consultation, and palliative care. The present recommendations are intended to serve as a foundation for patient-centered, appropriate, and transparent decision-making-always with the overarching aim of preserving the dignity and self-determination of the patients concerned.",

In aged laboratory animals, increased mucosal permeability has been associated with overall loss of mucosal integrity, but equivalent studies have not been conducted for the human colon. We address this knowledge gap by examining the number of intestinal stem cells and epithelial tight junction proteins, and densities of connective tissues, namely total collagen and elastin, on macroscopically normal ascending (AC; adults: 30-52 years and elderly: 70 - 89 years) and descending (DC; adults: 42-60 years and elderly: 67 - 82 years) colon using immunohistochemistry and tinctorial staining techniques. The results demonstrated that in the ageing AC but not clearly in the DC, there was a significant decline in anti-junctional adhesion molecule-A, anti- occludin and anti-zonula occluden-1 tight junction protein expressions within the epithelium per mucosal unit area. Compared to younger adults, there was no consistent change in anti-claudin-2 protein in the DC from older adults (p = 0.068), but the level of expression tended to increase in the AC (p = 0.059). The number of olfactomedin-4 positive cells tended to be smaller (mean value: AC; 5.2 ± 0.6 vs. 4.9 ± 0.2/ crypt and DC: 5.6 ± 0.8 vs. 5.1 ± 0.3) but were not statistically significant with increasing age in both regions. Ageing increased the amount of elastin fibres within the muscularis mucosae in AC and DC, and there was a tendency for total collagen fibres to increase in the mucosa of the older adults DC (p = 0.061). These structural changes in the aged mucosa have potential to impact colonic functions and may contribute to the development of lower bowel disorders in a region-specific manner.",

      "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on an analysis of the literature regarding the effects of β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate (HMB). The following 12 points have been approved by the Research Committee of the Society: 1. HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that is naturally produced in both humans and other animals. Two forms of HMB have been studied: Calcium HMB (HMB-Ca) and a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA). HMB-FA appears to lead to increased appearance of HMB in the bloodstream when compared to HMB-Ca, though recent results are mixed. 2. The available safety/toxicity data suggest that chronic HMB-Ca and HMB-FA consumption are safe for oral HMB supplementation in humans up to at least one year. 3. There are no negative effects of HMB-Ca and HMB-FA on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in humans. There may be improvements in glucose metabolism in younger adults. 4. The primary mode of action of HMB appears to be through its dual mechanism to enhance muscle protein synthesis and suppress muscle protein breakdown. HMB's activation of mTORC1 is independent of the leucine-sensing pathway (Sestrin2-GATOR2 complex). 5. HMB may help reduce muscle damage and promote muscle recovery, which can promote muscle growth/repair. HMB may also have anti-inflammatory effects, which could contribute to reducing muscle damage and soreness. 6. HMB consumption in close proximity to an exercise bout may be beneficial to increase muscle protein synthesis and attenuate the inflammatory response. HMB can provide a beneficial physiological effect when consumed both acutely and chronically in humans. 7. Daily HMB supplementation (38 mg/kg body weight) in combination with exercise training may improve body composition through increasing lean mass and/or decreasing fat mass with benefits in participants across age, sex, and training status. The most pronounced of these improvements in body composition with HMB have been observed in studies with robust resistance training programs and dietary control. 8. HMB may improve strength and power in untrained individuals, but its performance benefits in trained athletes are mixed and increase with an increase in study duration (>6 weeks). HMB's beneficial effects on athletic performance are thought to be driven by improved recovery. 9. HMB supplementation appears to potentially have a positive impact on aerobic performance, especially in trained athletes. The mechanisms of the effects are unknown. 10. HMB supplementation may be important in a non-exercising sedentary and aging population to improve muscle strength, functionality, and muscle quality. The effects of HMB supplementation with exercise are varied, but the combination may have a beneficial effect on the treatment of age-associated sarcopenia under select conditions. 11. HMB may be effective in countering muscle disuse atrophy during periods of inactivity due to illness or injury. The modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism by HMB may be a potential mechanism for preventing disuse atrophy and aiding rehabilitation beyond HMB's effects on rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. 12. The efficacy of HMB in combination with certain nutrients may be enhanced under select conditions.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity, a subtype of obesity, is marked by reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, or sarcopenia, and poses a significant health challenge to older adults as it affects an estimated 28.3% of people aged >60 years. This subtype is unique to older adults as aging exacerbates sarcopenia and obesity due to changes in energy metabolism, hormones and inflammatory markers, and lifestyle factors. Traditional treatments for sarcopenic obesity have been focused on exercise and dietary modifications to reduce fat while maintaining muscle mass. Newer glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor agonists (GIP/GLP-1RAs), including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, have shown great promise to reduce weight, treat obesity-related complications, improve physical function, and improve quality of life, in younger clinical trial populations. However, the use of GLP-1RAs and GIP/GLP-1RAs has not been exhaustively evaluated in older adults with sarcopenic obesity. These medications come with the risk of loss of muscle mass and an increased rate of adverse events. Thus, clinicians should use them cautiously by weighing the potential benefits against their risks. Herein, we discuss a possible approach to using GLP-1RAs and GIP/GLP-1RAs in patients with sarcopenic obesity, including considerations for patient identification, monitoring, maintenance, and discontinuation. In this article we also discuss the emerging treatments that will be available, which may include activin type II receptor antibodies and selective androgen receptor agonists. We conclude by highlighting the advancement of geroscience as a promising field for individualizing treatments in the future.",

      "abstract": "Modern cardiovascular medicine and surgery enable the treatment of complex cardiovascular disease, even in elderly and multimorbid patients, through increasingly sophisticated procedures. Nevertheless, there are situations in which surgical intervention appears medically inappropriate or is explicitly declined by the patient. Similarly, it may become necessary in the postoperative course to revise the original therapeutic goals-particularly when continued survival depends upon prolonged intensive care unit treatment, or when the anticipated quality of life, from the patient's perspective, appears inadequate. While established guidelines and position papers-most notably from the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine-are already available in the field of intensive care medicine, a discipline-specific framework for cardiac surgery has been lacking thus far. This inaugural position paper issued by the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery seeks to contribute to the definition of clinical and ethical standards in the context of therapeutic restraint (Section A) and to the redefinition of therapeutic goals (Section B) within our specialty. The aim is to promote a structured and multiprofessional approach that transparently integrates the core pillars of goal setting in therapy-namely, medical indication and patient autonomy-into a comprehensible decision-making framework. Achieving this objective requires close collaboration among physicians and nursing staff in cardiac surgery, cardiology, intensive care, anesthesiology, ethics consultation, and palliative care. The present recommendations are intended to serve as a foundation for patient-centered, appropriate, and transparent decision-making-always with the overarching aim of preserving the dignity and self-determination of the patients concerned.",

In aged laboratory animals, increased mucosal permeability has been associated with overall loss of mucosal integrity, but equivalent studies have not been conducted for the human colon. We address this knowledge gap by examining the number of intestinal stem cells and epithelial tight junction proteins, and densities of connective tissues, namely total collagen and elastin, on macroscopically normal ascending (AC; adults: 30-52 years and elderly: 70 - 89 years) and descending (DC; adults: 42-60 years and elderly: 67 - 82 years) colon using immunohistochemistry and tinctorial staining techniques. The results demonstrated that in the ageing AC but not clearly in the DC, there was a significant decline in anti-junctional adhesion molecule-A, anti- occludin and anti-zonula occluden-1 tight junction protein expressions within the epithelium per mucosal unit area. Compared to younger adults, there was no consistent change in anti-claudin-2 protein in the DC from older adults (p = 0.068), but the level of expression tended to increase in the AC (p = 0.059). The number of olfactomedin-4 positive cells tended to be smaller (mean value: AC; 5.2 ± 0.6 vs. 4.9 ± 0.2/ crypt and DC: 5.6 ± 0.8 vs. 5.1 ± 0.3) but were not statistically significant with increasing age in both regions. Ageing increased the amount of elastin fibres within the muscularis mucosae in AC and DC, and there was a tendency for total collagen fibres to increase in the mucosa of the older adults DC (p = 0.061). These structural changes in the aged mucosa have potential to impact colonic functions and may contribute to the development of lower bowel disorders in a region-specific manner.",

      "abstract": "Mirabegron is a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist that can help with incontinence, dysuria, and bladder overactivity. It alleviates the symptoms of prostate enlargement and urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the elderly. We aimed to explore Mirabegron's antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties, trying to benefit people suffering from urinary tract infections and having an overactive bladder. Mirabegron's putative antibacterial activity was investigated using the well diffusion method (In Vitro). Infected rats were treated with mirabegron (10 mg/kg, oral) and used for evaluation of immunomodulatory actions (In Vivo). We tested the antibacterial activity in vitro against numerous bacterial strains, including Escherichia coli (E. coli). The phagocytic activity and survival of peritoneal macrophages were examined. Also, serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and interferon-γ (INF-γ) were estimated in E. coli-infected rats. We found that mirabegron exhibited significant antibacterial activity, particularly against E. coli. Phagocytic activity increased notably in vivo, indicating an improved innate immune response. Mirabegron also demonstrated a substantial rise in immunoglobulin and cytokine levels, enhancing acquired immunity. According to our findings, in vitro and in vivo tests of mirabegron revealed possible antibacterial activity as well as immunomodulatory properties. Mirabegron could alleviate symptomatic UTIs.",
